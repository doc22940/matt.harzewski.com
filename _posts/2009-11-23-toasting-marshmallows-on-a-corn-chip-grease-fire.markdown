Neat, isn't it? Tortilla chips, apparently, burn quite well if you put a match to them. If you take 2 to 3 of them and (taking the proper safety precautions) set them on fire, they will burn brilliantly for several minutes, giving you ample time to toast a marshmallow or two.<!-- more -->

Corn chips (the Medallion brand available at Sams Club is what we used) contain a bit of oil, which you can see bubbling on the surface of the chip as the chip is consumed by the flames. Oil, as you surely know, is a great fuel source. When you set the chips alight, you're creating a small grease fire, which will burn until the fuel source is used up, or until the fire is manually extinguished.

**Safety note:** If you attempt this, **do _not_ pour water on the fire** in attempt to extinguish the flames. Grease fires can not be doused with water, and any attempts to do so will result in a [very dangerous fireball](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmjSUlKoMXE). If the fire gets out of hand and needs to be put out, either pour baking soda on the flames, or use a fire extinguisher. Also, the fire pictured above was inside an aluminum tray resting in a stainless steel kitchen sink. It is recommended that you have a similar setup, as the flames can grow to a fairly large height.

_Attempt this at your own risk. I assume no responsibility for your stupidity if you decide to play with grease fires. Unless you are a responsible adult __(i.e. not Reddit/Digg users)__, or are operating under the supervision of a responsible adult, do not try this._
