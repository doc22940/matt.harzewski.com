Apple has just released their new iPod lineup for fall 2008, and have [posted their keynote online](http://events.apple.com.edgesuite.net/0809dt4bs89/event/index.html). Jobs and crew have really done good this year. New Nanos starting at $150 (they are crazy thin, and come is some real slick colors); a $250 120GB Classic; thinner iPod Touches starting at $229, with a few hardware and software changes (and the 2.1 software update is free for older Touches running 2.0 firmware).
