It's been a long time since I've had an actively updated personal blog. I neglected this one for a few years, despite my occasional urge to write about something that was simply too many degrees of separation away from the topics of my other blogs. I blame a mix of forgetfulness, laziness and not having the "right" format and design.

I think I finally stuck the landing with this one.

Besides the lightweight design, one of the more interesting features I put into the new theme is support for Post Formats. I'm using the Link format to create link posts in the style of [Daring Fireball](http://daringfireball.net/), coupled with [Alex King's neat plugin](http://alexking.org/blog/2011/10/25/wordpress-post-formats-admin-ui) to make a simple UI for them.<!-- more -->

Now for the really exciting part. I finally managed to secure `Harzewski.com` after its previous owner (a distant relative I don't know personally) let it expire. I picked it up with a little help from [SnapNames](https://www.snapnames.com/) and moved the blog to a shiny new subdomain at `matt.harzewski.com`. Good thing I ran that whois search on a whim, a mere week before the drop period...

Well, there you have it. A new URL, a fresh design, and hopefully a new beginning for this blog.
