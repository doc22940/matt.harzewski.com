Here's an idea, how about all of these ISPs use one bandwidth cap formula:

_x * 60 * 60 * 24 * 30_, where x would be the speed of the internet connection.

There's no point in selling someone 30mb/sec cable internet access if they can still only download as much data as I can on my 1mb/sec DSL in a month.

I'm tired of all this talk of bandwidth caps and such. ISPs, give your customers what they're paying for. Internet access is expensive enough as it is without making things worse.

Or at least provide the option for a customer to pay for more usage instead of cutting them off entirely...
