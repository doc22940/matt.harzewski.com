> Term first coined in 1985 by Peter Harzewski that states, "Any random piece of visual material (film or video) - and any random piece of music will eventually synchronize and appear to be intentionally linked."


To illustrate the effect, here is [an animated image](http://matt.harzewski.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/eccleston_drwho.gif) of Christopher Eccleston from the 2005 season of _[Doctor Who](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_who)_. If you combine it with a completely unrelated music sample, [you get this](http://gifsound.com/?gif=http%3A%2F%2Fmatt.harzewski.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2012%2F05%2Feccleston_drwho.gif&sound=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D5-_p4uxVKlc&start=0).

The Harzewski Effect seems to have vanished from Wikipedia—apparently some of the editors decided it was a "neologism" and removed the article—but you can still see it referenced on some websites, such as the one for [this media production company](http://www.fullcirclestudios2.com/EntAudio.htm).
