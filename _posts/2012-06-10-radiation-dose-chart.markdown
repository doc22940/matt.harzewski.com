Interestingly, there have been cases where the radiation output from a coal plant has tripped the very sensitive sensors in nuclear plants several miles away.

Also, there is an important difference between [ionizing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionising_radiation) and [non-ionizing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-ionising_radiation) radiation. The vast majority of non-ionizing radiation you would ever be exposed to is harmless.
