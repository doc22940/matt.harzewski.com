I've been enjoying Pat Rothfuss's _Kingkiller Chronicles_ series lately. It's one of the best epic fantasy series I've read in awhile (right up there with a couple of my other favorites: _The Way of Kings_ and _The Wheel of Time_) and it's well worth reading if you like elaborate stories involving wizards.
