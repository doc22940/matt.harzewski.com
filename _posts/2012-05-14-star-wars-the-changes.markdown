Ever wonder what exactly was changes with each re-release of the original Star Wars trilogy? Chris Gould compares the theatrical releases to the VHS, DVD and Blu-Ray Special Editions. Sure, some annoying changes were made—like Han shooting first—but other edits dramatically improve the quality of the film.

([_A New Hope_](http://www.dvdactive.com/editorial/articles/star-wars-the-changes-part-one.html), [_The Empire Strikes Back_](http://www.dvdactive.com/editorial/articles/star-wars-the-changes-part-two.html), [_Return of the Jedi_](http://www.dvdactive.com/editorial/articles/star-wars-the-changes-part-three.html), the [prequels](http://www.dvdactive.com/editorial/articles/star-wars-the-changes-part-four.html).)

This may be a bit controversial among Star Wars fans, but I much prefer the new ending of _Return of the Jedi_ (sans Hayden Christensen, of course) with its smoother editing and beautiful orchestral music to the silly "Yub Nub" Ewok chant.
