It's only a matter of time until Netflix does the same. The studios can only push so far before the service becomes too unattractive and subscribers start leaving again. I give it to the next contract renewal. (You can't get [much more ridiculouss](http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/entertainmentnewsbuzz/2012/01/warner-bros-netflix-deal-includes-delay-in-queues.html) than a 56 day delay _and_ forbidding users from adding the movies to their queues until after the delay.)
