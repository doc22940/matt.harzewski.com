I'm **Matt Harzewski**. I've been programming since the age of ten, when I started porting BASIC listings from old books to JavaScript (long before Node.js existed), and have been a part of the blogging scene since the early 2000s. Presently, I am pursuing an undergraduate degree in Computer Science.
